<!--
The <span> tag is used to wrap individual characters or entities in HTML to make them stylable or interactive without breaking text flow. It serves as an inline container that:

Enables targeted styling: You can apply CSS to a specific character (like changing color, size, or font weight) since raw characters can't be directly styled.

Preserves layout: As an inline element, <span> doesn't disrupt the surrounding text, unlike block elements such as <div>.

Allows interactivity: Adding an id or class makes it easy to target with JavaScript for behaviors like click events or dynamic updates.

Improves clarity and accessibility: Though non-semantic, <span> can hold attributes or class names to assist tools like screen readers.

In short, <span> acts as a flexible, invisible container for styling, scripting, or enhancing small pieces of inline content.
